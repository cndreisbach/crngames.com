	<h2>News</h2>

	<h3>9 April 2008</h3>

	<p>I recently closed my long-standing forum at The Forge, and it&#8217;s been quite a while since I put out any news or support for my games, so I thought it might be time for an update. If you&#8217;ve enjoyed any of my games, you&#8217;ll want to know about my future plans.</p>

	<p>I&#8217;ve always been a hobbyist at heart, and I think my low-profile business and loving approach to games has borne that out. As a hobbyist, my interest ebbs and wanes, and I have other engaging goals in my life, such as my family and my contributions to open-source software.</p>

	<p>I&#8217;m looking to move to being even more of a hobbyist, and looking to have a better presence for fans of my games at the same time. That&#8217;s a hard set of goals, though, so I&#8217;m taking a little while to reevaluate my approach. There will definitely be more news soon. What I can promise is that my games will continue to be in print, and that I&#8217;m working hard to make sure they remain supported and even expanded upon.</p>

	<p>If you want to keep up with <span class="caps">CRN</span> Games news, or want a forum to talk about my games, please feel free to join the <span class="caps">CRN</span> Games e-mail group.</p>
