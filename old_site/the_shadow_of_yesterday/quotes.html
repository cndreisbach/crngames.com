		  	<p>&#8220;A unique weird fantasy setting that&#8217;s as intriguing as anything Robert E. Howard or Fritz Leiber put together. It&#8217;s a testament to the quality of the whole package that this is one of the few games I&#8217;ve found that I want to run unaltered, unadulterated, just right out of the box.&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8212; Paul Tevis, &#8220;Have Games Will Travel&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;The <span class="caps">TSOY</span> system excellently combines elements from a hundred other fantasy games, and yet still manages to be its own unique beast. The mechanics keep the action fast, furious, and at a human scale.</p>

	<p>&#8220;The mechanics, however, are at their best when they are tied into the game&#8217;s extraordinary setting. Near is an awesome piece of work, a fantasy world full of dark people and disparate cultures, a deeply human place where your characters can become people. It is, quite simply, the most adult fantasy world that I&#8217;ve ever seen.&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8212; A judge in the 2004 Indie <span class="caps">RPG</span> Awards</p>

	<p>&#8220;The Shadow of Yesterday cuts the crap and gets to the heart of what makes fantasy enjoyable.&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8212; Seriously, another judge in the 2004 Indie <span class="caps">RPG</span> Awards</p>

	<p>&#8220;The game is a great read (I&#8217;m one of those who thinks that an <span class="caps">RPG</span> should be as much fun to read as it is to play) ... Maybe it&#8217;s just me, but Shadow of Yesterday is for me, as an indie game, the right size &#8211; both in terms of background given and rules supplied et al&#8230;. SoY, on the other hand, gives enough without leaving my gamer&#8217;s appetite growling &#8211; the right amount of material to prime the engine, as it were.&#8221;</p>
