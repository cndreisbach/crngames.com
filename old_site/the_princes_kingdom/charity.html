		  	<p><em>The Princes&#8217; Kingdom</em> was originally written as a present for my friend, <a href="http://www.lumpley.com">Vincent Baker</a>. I used the rules of his game <em>Dogs in the Vineyard</em> shamelessly, and I enjoyed the giving as much as he enjoyed the receiving. Upon further thought, though, we decided I should develop the game further and sell it. I refused to do so without the proceeds going to a charity of his choosing.</p>

	<p>So he chose the <a href="http://www.afsc.org">American Friends Service Committee</a>. It&#8217;s a great charity, founded on Quaker values of peace, love, and justice. The <span class="caps">AFSC</span> is a Nobel Peace Prize winning organization for their relief efforts in the two World Wars. I think their values really fit the values of the game, which is doubly good. </p>

	<p>I can&#8217;t do their organization justice with my words, so I&#8217;ll let them speak:</p>

	<blockquote>
		<p>We seek to understand and address the root causes of poverty, injustice, and war. We hope to act with courage and vision in taking initiatives that may not be popular.</p>
		<p>We are called to confront, nonviolently, powerful institutions of violence, evil, oppression, and injustice. Such actions may engage us in creative tumult and tension in the process of basic change. We seek opportunities to help reconcile enemies and to facilitate a peaceful and just resolution of conflict.</p>
		<p>We work to relieve and prevent suffering through both immediate aid and long-term development and seek to serve the needs of people on all sides of violent strife.</p>
		<p>We ground our work at the community level both at home and abroad in partnership with those who suffer the conditions we seek to change and informed by their strength and vision.</p>
		<p>We work with all people, the poor and the materially comfortable, the disenfranchised and the powerful in pursuit of justice. We encourage collaboration in social transformation towards a society that recognizes the dignity of each person. We believe that the Spirit can move among all these groups, making great change possible.</p>
		<p>Seeking to transform the institutions of society, we are ourselves transformed in the process. As we work in the world around us, our awareness grows that the AFSC&#8217;s own organizational life must change to reflect the same goals we urge others to achieve.</p>
		<p>We find in our life of service a great adventure. We are committed to this Spirit-led journey, undertaken &#8220;to see what love can do,&#8221; and we are ever renewed by it.</p>
